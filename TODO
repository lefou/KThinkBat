- ASUS/ACER: calculate W from the values provided by ACPI
- show remaining time 
- integrate ibam battery monitoring fassility, for (better) time computation
- KThinkBat needs at least one icon, svg prefered. Artists arround?
- Config-Dialog: ACPI proc path, action on click 
- there should be a symbol such as power plug next to it when connected to AC
- make backend selectable: tp_smapi or ACPI
- add APM option for older Laptops. Still needed?
